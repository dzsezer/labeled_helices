# spin_labeled_helices
Double stranded DNA and RNA helices with spin labels

This notebook engages with the PELDOR (Pulsed Electron-eLectron DOouble Resonance) measurements published in the following two papers:

1. Andriy Marko, Vasyl Denysenkov, Dominik Margraf, Pavol Cekan, Olav Schiemann, Snorri Th. Sigurdsson, and Thomas F. Prisner; Conformational Flexibility of DNA, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2011, 133, 13375–13379.

2. Karin Halbmair, Jan Seikowski, Igor Tkach, Claudia Höbartner, Deniz Sezer, Marina Bennati; High-resolution measurement of long-range distances in RNA: pulse EPR spectroscopy with TEMPO-labeled nucleotides, Chemical Science 2016, 7, 3172-3180.

Additional, unpublished measurements performed by Maximilian Gauger in the group of Prof. Thomas Prisner are also analyzed.
